Arduino code to MIDI-fy an old digital keyboard instrument

You can learn more about this project and how to build it [here](https://medium.com/@mero11.gh/midi-fying-an-old-casio-digital-keyboard-6a9ae9f3092b?sk=4bbd402e457ac49a23d123bb412c1bf2)

Note that I've added SoftwareSerial on pins A0 and A1 for debugging should that be helpful. Have fun ðŸ’ƒ
